# Project Plan for Debugger Module

## Remaining Tasks:
1. **Define the Functional Requirements**:
   - Outline what functionality your `debugger` module should provide.

2. **Develop Interfaces**:
   - Create interfaces in the `interfaces/` directory to define the expected behavior of components.

3. **Implement Concrete Classes**:
   - Write concrete implementations in the `concrete_implementations/` directory based on the defined interfaces.

4. **Utility Functions**:
   - Add helper methods in the `utils/` directory for common functionalities that may be used across your module.

5. **Write Tests**:
   - Develop unit tests in the `tests/` directory to ensure that your implementations are working correctly.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Write documentation for your module to explain how to use it and what each part does.

7. **Version Control**:
   - Set up a Git repository if you haven't already, to track changes to your project.

8. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
   - If applicable, set up CI/CD to automate testing and deployment.

9. **Prepare for Distribution**:
   - Create a `setup.py` file for packaging and distribution if you plan to share your module.

10. **Review and Refactor**:
    - Periodically review the code and refactor as needed for improvement in design and performance.
